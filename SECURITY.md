# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in AISDK Storefront, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please email us at security@yourdomain.com to report any security vulnerabilities. Include the following information:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
3. **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
5. **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions
2. **Audit code** to find any similar problems
3. **Prepare fixes** for all supported versions
4. **Release patches** as soon as possible

We will coordinate the disclosure with you. We prefer to fully disclose the issue as soon as possible after a user mitigation is available. We will also mention your name as the reporter of the issue unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this repository, please follow these security best practices:

### 1. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Never commit `node_modules` directory
- Review dependency licenses

### 2. Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files (except `.env.example`)
- Use strong, unique values for secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for development and production

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Enable 2FA where possible
- Never store passwords in plain text

### 4. Data Protection
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS in production
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

### 5. Error Handling
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log security events
- Implement rate limiting
- Use error boundaries in React components

### 6. Code Review
- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Run security scans on pull requests
- Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Verify no secrets are committed
